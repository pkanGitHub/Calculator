How to set up backend virtual environment

Can ignore this if you already have it installed.
Run these commands in your backend root directory to Install:
    (make sure python version is the same, if you installed python3.9, use <python3.9 -m venv venv> and <pip3.9 install Flask>)
    python3.10 -m venv venv - to create virtual environment(venv) directory
    source venv/bin/activate - to activate venv
    pip3.10 install Flask - install flask

After installation you should be able to start you're development server by running <python3.10 server.py>

in this case it willl be localhost:5000/members
